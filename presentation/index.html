        <h2>Gir's Disguises: Blending In... Sort Of</h2>
        <p>
          As Zim's malfunctioning but adorable robot sidekick, Gir is
          technically supposed to help with Earth infiltration. His main
          strategy? Costumes. Lots of them. While they're meant to help him
          "blend in" with humans, Gir's choices are usually more chaotic than
          covert. Still, they're hilarious and oddly endearing.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some of his most unforgettable looks:</p>

        <h4>The Green Dog Suit</h4>

        <p>
          A floppy green dog onesie with a zipper and oversized eyes. This is
          Gir's standard disguise form. Supposedly it helps him pass as Zim's
          Earth pet. While it's not exactly realistic, the humans in Invader Zim
          are... let's just say, not very observant.
        </p>

        <h4>Krazy Taco Gir</h4>

          A mustache and a Krazy Taco hat. This outfit shows up when Gir takes a
          job at a fast food chain called Krazy Taco. He fully commits to the
          job, enthusiastically yelling about tacos and dancing like a maniac..
